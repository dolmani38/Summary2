They say that the shrinking space on aeroplanes is not only uncomfortable - it's putting our health and safety in danger. More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? This week, a U.S consumer advisory group set up by the Department of Transportation said at a public hearing that while the government is happy to set standards for animals flying on planes, it doesn't stipulate a minimum amount of space for humans. 'In a world where animals have more rights to space and food than humans,' said Charlie Leocha, consumer representative on the committee.\\xa0'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking? Tests conducted by the FAA use planes with a 31 inch pitch, a standard which on some airlines has decreased . Many economy seats on United Airlines have 30 inches of room, while some airlines offer as little as 28 inches . Cynthia Corbertt, a human factors researcher with the Federal Aviation Administration, that it conducts tests on how quickly passengers can leave a plane. But these tests are conducted using planes with 31 inches between each row of seats, a standard which on some airlines has decreased, reported the Detroit News. The distance between two seats from one point on a seat to the same point on the seat behind it is known as the pitch. While most airlines stick to a pitch of 31 inches or above, some fall below this. While United Airlines has 30 inches of space, Gulf Air economy seats have between 29 and 32 inches, Air Asia offers 29 inches and Spirit Airlines offers just 28 inches. British Airways has a seat pitch of 31 inches, while easyJet has 29 inches, Thomson's short haul seat pitch is 28 inches, and Virgin Atlantic's is 30-31.\""

            "It is also preparing an overhaul of the way profiles look, expanding the number of interests people can add.\n",
            "Earlier this month Tinder rolled out ‘Tinder Plus’, a premium service allowing people to ‘undo’ a like or change their location.\n",
            "A study has found that nearly two thirds of dating app users are men - and one in five will pay for premium services.\n",
            "Sixteen to 34 year-olds make up the majority of mobile dating app users, accounting for 70 per cent of the total user base.\n",
            "The study, carried out by London-based research firm GlobalWebIndex, also found that six per cent of web users currently use a location-based dating app.\n",
            "Significantly, just a fifth of dating app users are paying for an online dating service,' co-authors Jason Mander and Felim McGrath said in the report.\n",
            "But now they have set a limit on the number of ‘likes’ a user can perform in one day - which seems to be set at 100.\n",
            "When a user reaches this limit, the app tells them ‘You’re Out of Likes’, and gives a countdown clock until 24 hours are up so they can start swiping again.\n",
            "But, below this clock, a big red button says ‘Get Unlimited Likes with Tinder Plus’.\n",
            "A price is then shown.\n",
            "But different users are reporting the app is asking for different amounts.\n",
            "It seems the prices range from around £1 49 a month to as high as £14 99 - but the reasons why are not clear.\n",
            "This means some users will pay £17 88 a year for Tinder Plus - but others, in the upper price category, will have to fork out a whopping £179 88 a year.\n",
            "This equates to some users inadvertently paying £162 more than others over the course of a year.\n",
            "Speaking to MailOnline, Rosette Pambakian, Vice President of Communications and Branding at Tinder, told MailOnline the app is testing out different price points ahead of a global release.\n",
            "'We are testing Tinder Plus in select markets at various price points before rolling it out globally,' she said.\n",
            "'The UK is one of our test markets, so a certain portion of the population was given access to Tinder Plus at varying price points '.\n",
            "However, it is still not clear how the app decides how much to charge a user - and whether it is based on location or activity.\n",
            "In addition, Tinder has not commented on whether a user will receive a refund if they ultimately paid over the odds for the final price of the service.\n",

            "An Israeli geologist claims he has ‘confirmed’ the existence and authenticity of a tomb belonging to Jesus and his son in Jerusalem.\n",
            "After extensive chemical tests, Dr Arye Shimron says he has linked the James Ossuary – a 1st-century chalk box that some believe hold the bones of Jesus' brother – to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood.\n",
            "The research could have enormous ramifications as it suggests that Jesus was married, fathered a child and that a physical resurrection did not take place.\n",
            "Scroll down for video.\n",
            "After running 150 chemical tests, an expert claims to have linked the James Ossuary (pictured) – a 1st-century chalk box that was used for containing the bones of the dead – to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood.\n",
            "According to geoarcheologist Dr Shimron, the 'son of God' was buried with nine other people, including ‘Judah, son of Jesus’ and his wife, named Mary.\n",
            "Dr Shimron’s work has renewed controversy over the Talpiot tomb, which was discovered in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus,The Jerusalem Post reported.\n",
            "Bones were discovered inside ossuaries, including one that bore the inscription, ‘Jesus, son of Joseph'.\n",
            "Others included the names Maria, Joseph, Mary, Yose, Matthew and most controversially, ‘Judah, son of Jesus’.\n",
            "Joseph, Mary and Jesus were all common names at the time and a statistician from the University of Toronto said that they each made up eight per cent of the population.\n",
            "However, a very small percentage would have had the same family name combination as described in the Bible.\n",
            "Dr Shimron’s work has renewed the controversy over the Talpiot tomb, which was found in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus (a portrait is pictured) The long-disputed long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood (marked) and is now sealed beneath a concrete slab after building work took place some years ago.\n",
            "Probing this connection, Dr Shimron and documentary maker Simcha Jacobovici looked closer at the ossuaries, including the James Ossuary, which is held by a private owner and bears the inscription, ‘James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus’.\n",
            "The James Ossuary is a first century chalk example of a box that was used to hold the bones of the dead.\n",
            "But it stands out because it bears the inscription 'James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus' on one side.\n",
            "The inscription is considered significant because it may provide archaeological evidence of Jesus,.\n",
            "The existence of the ossuary was announced in 2002, but its authenticity was immediately challenged.\n",
            "The box's owner was charged with forging part of the inscription and while he was found innocent seven years later, the judge said the acquittal 'does not mean that the inscription on the ossuary is authentic or that it was written 2,000 years ago'.\n",
            "Now, Dr Shimron claims the chemical signature on the ‘crust’ of the box matches that of a tomb in Jerusalem known as the ‘Jesus Family tomb’ where other ossuaries were found bearing the names of Jesus and Mary as well as ‘Judah, son of Jesus’.\n",
            "The owner of the ossuary, Oded Golan, was accused of forging the inscription shortly after its discovery by an academic from the Sorbonne in Paris, but he was later found innocent.\n",
            "Other experts and archaeologists have rejected the claim that the Jerusalem tomb is connected with Jesus at all.\n",
            "Recently Dr Shimron gained access to the James Ossuary and scraped beneath the box's patina, the layer that forms on metal over time.\n",
            "He ran around 150 tests on the chemistry of samples from 25 different ossuaries – 15 of which were from unrelated tombs – and found that traces of magnesium, iron and silicon from the James Ossuary matched the chemical signature of Talpiot tomb.\n",
            "The Talpiot ossuaries were covered in a thick layer of ‘Rendzina’ soil, which is characteristic of the hills of East Jerusalem when they were found and has a unique chemistry.\n",
            "Dr Shimron worked from the assumption that an earthquake of 363AD flooded the tomb with soil and mud to cover the ossuaries, effectively forming a vacuum and freezing them in time.\n",
            "Soil that seeped into the box matched that found in the Talpiot ossuaries, indicating that it had lain for years alongside others in the ‘holy’ location.\n",
            "Bones were discovered there in ossuaries, or chalk boxes, including one that bears the inscription, ‘Jesus, son of Joseph' with others bearing the names of Maria, Joseph, Mary, Yose, Matthew and most controversially, ‘Judah, son of Jesus’.\n",
            "Here an inscription that says 'Yoseph' on an ossuary.\n",
            "Because bones were found in the ossuaries, it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection (portrayed in this tapestry) which is the belief of more traditional Christians, while others accept the event was spiritual.\n",
            "Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to a writer and leading atheist activist.\n",
            "David Fitzgerald, a San Francisco based author, believes he has compiled compelling evidence that proves Jesus did not exist.\n",
            "He claims there are no contemporary mentions of Jesus in historical accounts from the time when he was supposed to have lived, yet other Jewish sect leaders from the time do appear.\n",
            "Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to a writer and leading atheist activist.\n",
            "A mosaic of Christ is shown.\n",
            "He also points to discrepancies in the early gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke, claiming these were written decades after the supposed time of Jesus.\n",
            "Instead he insists the disciples of Jesus were also probably not real and their names only later attached to the gospels to lend them credence.\n",
            "Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years.\n",
            "'Or it means he didn't do all these things at all.\n",
            "'The first gospel of Christianity appears to have been a literary allegory that were written decades after the time they portray.\n",

            "The famous statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is shown.\n",
            "'By the time of Paul there appears to have been plenty of different \"Lord's suppers\" as he complains about the existence of other gospels and messiahs.\n",
            "'It appears that early Christianity managed to take the stories from these other faiths and incorporate them into the story of Jesus '.\n",
            "Mr Fitzgerald said: 'There is nothing implausible to think that Jesus was a real person, but I just don't think that he can have been a single person if he existed at all.\n",
            "'We also have no mention of Jesus in other historical texts from the time.\n",
            "There were certainly people writing about Judea at the time like Philo of Alexandria.\n",
            "'During this period there were many other messiahs and wannabe messiahs who did far less exciting things than Jesus, but all of them managed something Jesus did not - to make a dent on the historical record.\n",
            "'Two billion people believe all these miracles happened yet there is no evidence they did '.\n",
            "Jacobovici told The Jerusalem Post: ‘This find illustrates that the James Ossuary is authentic and the Jesus Family tomb indeed belongs to the family of Jesus of Nazareth ’ Dr Shumron told The New York Times: ‘I think I’ve got really powerful, virtually unequivocal evidence that the James ossuary spent most of its lifetime, or death time, in the Talpiot Tomb ’ The retired senior researchers of the Geological Survey of Israel, added: ‘ The evidence is beyond what I expected ’ The duo are aware that the findings could rock the Christian church, but insist the research is scientific and not theological.\n",

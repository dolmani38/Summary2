              "\"Ever noticed how plane seats appear to be getting smaller and smaller? With increasing numbers of people taking to the skies, some experts are questioning if having such packed out planes is putting passengers at risk. They say that the shrinking space on aeroplanes is not only uncomfortable - it's putting our health and safety in danger. More than squabbling over the arm rest, shrinking space on planes putting our health and safety in danger? This week, a U.S consumer advisory group set up by the Department of Transportation said at a public hearing that while the government is happy to set standards for animals flying on planes, it doesn't stipulate a minimum amount of space for humans. 'In a world where animals have more rights to space and food than humans,' said Charlie Leocha, consumer representative on the committee.\\xa0'It is time that the DOT and FAA take a stand for humane treatment of passengers.' But could crowding on planes lead to more serious issues than fighting for space in the overhead lockers, crashing elbows and seat back kicking? Tests conducted by the FAA use planes with a 31 inch pitch, a standard which on some airlines has decreased . Many economy seats on United Airlines have 30 inches of room, while some airlines offer as little as 28 inches . Cynthia Corbertt, a human factors researcher with the Federal Aviation Administration, that it conducts tests on how quickly passengers can leave a plane. But these tests are conducted using planes with 31 inches between each row of seats, a standard which on some airlines has decreased, reported the Detroit News. The distance between two seats from one point on a seat to the same point on the seat behind it is known as the pitch. While most airlines stick to a pitch of 31 inches or above, some fall below this. While United Airlines has 30 inches of space, Gulf Air economy seats have between 29 and 32 inches, Air Asia offers 29 inches and Spirit Airlines offers just 28 inches. British Airways has a seat pitch of 31 inches, while easyJet has 29 inches, Thomson's short haul seat pitch is 28 inches, and Virgin Atlantic's is 30-31.\""

            "An Israeli geologist claims he has ‘confirmed’ the existence and authenticity of a tomb belonging to Jesus and his son in Jerusalem.\n",
            "After extensive chemical tests, Dr Arye Shimron says he has linked the James Ossuary – a 1st-century chalk box that some believe hold the bones of Jesus' brother – to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood.\n",
            "The research could have enormous ramifications as it suggests that Jesus was married, fathered a child and that a physical resurrection did not take place.\n",
            "Scroll down for video.\n",
            "After running 150 chemical tests, an expert claims to have linked the James Ossuary (pictured) – a 1st-century chalk box that was used for containing the bones of the dead – to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood.\n",
            "According to geoarcheologist Dr Shimron, the 'son of God' was buried with nine other people, including ‘Judah, son of Jesus’ and his wife, named Mary.\n",
            "Dr Shimron’s work has renewed controversy over the Talpiot tomb, which was discovered in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus,The Jerusalem Post reported.\n",
            "Bones were discovered inside ossuaries, including one that bore the inscription, ‘Jesus, son of Joseph'.\n",
            "Others included the names Maria, Joseph, Mary, Yose, Matthew and most controversially, ‘Judah, son of Jesus’.\n",
            "Joseph, Mary and Jesus were all common names at the time and a statistician from the University of Toronto said that they each made up eight per cent of the population.\n",
            "However, a very small percentage would have had the same family name combination as described in the Bible.\n",
            "Dr Shimron’s work has renewed the controversy over the Talpiot tomb, which was found in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus (a portrait is pictured) The long-disputed long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood (marked) and is now sealed beneath a concrete slab after building work took place some years ago.\n",
            "Probing this connection, Dr Shimron and documentary maker Simcha Jacobovici looked closer at the ossuaries, including the James Ossuary, which is held by a private owner and bears the inscription, ‘James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus’.\n",
            "The James Ossuary is a first century chalk example of a box that was used to hold the bones of the dead.\n",
            "But it stands out because it bears the inscription 'James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus' on one side.\n",
            "The inscription is considered significant because it may provide archaeological evidence of Jesus,.\n",
            "The existence of the ossuary was announced in 2002, but its authenticity was immediately challenged.\n",
            "The box's owner was charged with forging part of the inscription and while he was found innocent seven years later, the judge said the acquittal 'does not mean that the inscription on the ossuary is authentic or that it was written 2,000 years ago'.\n",
            "Now, Dr Shimron claims the chemical signature on the ‘crust’ of the box matches that of a tomb in Jerusalem known as the ‘Jesus Family tomb’ where other ossuaries were found bearing the names of Jesus and Mary as well as ‘Judah, son of Jesus’.\n",
            "The owner of the ossuary, Oded Golan, was accused of forging the inscription shortly after its discovery by an academic from the Sorbonne in Paris, but he was later found innocent.\n",
            "Other experts and archaeologists have rejected the claim that the Jerusalem tomb is connected with Jesus at all.\n",
            "Recently Dr Shimron gained access to the James Ossuary and scraped beneath the box's patina, the layer that forms on metal over time.\n",
            "He ran around 150 tests on the chemistry of samples from 25 different ossuaries – 15 of which were from unrelated tombs – and found that traces of magnesium, iron and silicon from the James Ossuary matched the chemical signature of Talpiot tomb.\n",
            "The Talpiot ossuaries were covered in a thick layer of ‘Rendzina’ soil, which is characteristic of the hills of East Jerusalem when they were found and has a unique chemistry.\n",
            "Dr Shimron worked from the assumption that an earthquake of 363AD flooded the tomb with soil and mud to cover the ossuaries, effectively forming a vacuum and freezing them in time.\n",
            "Soil that seeped into the box matched that found in the Talpiot ossuaries, indicating that it had lain for years alongside others in the ‘holy’ location.\n",
            "Bones were discovered there in ossuaries, or chalk boxes, including one that bears the inscription, ‘Jesus, son of Joseph' with others bearing the names of Maria, Joseph, Mary, Yose, Matthew and most controversially, ‘Judah, son of Jesus’.\n",
            "Here an inscription that says 'Yoseph' on an ossuary.\n",
            "Because bones were found in the ossuaries, it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection (portrayed in this tapestry) which is the belief of more traditional Christians, while others accept the event was spiritual.\n",
            "Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to a writer and leading atheist activist.\n",
            "David Fitzgerald, a San Francisco based author, believes he has compiled compelling evidence that proves Jesus did not exist.\n",
            "He claims there are no contemporary mentions of Jesus in historical accounts from the time when he was supposed to have lived, yet other Jewish sect leaders from the time do appear.\n",

            "A mosaic of Christ is shown.\n",
            "He also points to discrepancies in the early gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke, claiming these were written decades after the supposed time of Jesus.\n",
            "Instead he insists the disciples of Jesus were also probably not real and their names only later attached to the gospels to lend them credence.\n",
            "Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years.\n",
            "'Or it means he didn't do all these things at all.\n",
            "'The first gospel of Christianity appears to have been a literary allegory that were written decades after the time they portray.\n",

            "'By the time of Paul there appears to have been plenty of different \"Lord's suppers\" as he complains about the existence of other gospels and messiahs.\n",
            "'It appears that early Christianity managed to take the stories from these other faiths and incorporate them into the story of Jesus '.\n",
            "Mr Fitzgerald said: 'There is nothing implausible to think that Jesus was a real person, but I just don't think that he can have been a single person if he existed at all.\n",
            "'We also have no mention of Jesus in other historical texts from the time.\n",
            "There were certainly people writing about Judea at the time like Philo of Alexandria.\n",
            "'During this period there were many other messiahs and wannabe messiahs who did far less exciting things than Jesus, but all of them managed something Jesus did not - to make a dent on the historical record.\n",

            "Jacobovici told The Jerusalem Post: ‘This find illustrates that the James Ossuary is authentic and the Jesus Family tomb indeed belongs to the family of Jesus of Nazareth ’ Dr Shumron told The New York Times: ‘I think I’ve got really powerful, virtually unequivocal evidence that the James ossuary spent most of its lifetime, or death time, in the Talpiot Tomb ’ The retired senior researchers of the Geological Survey of Israel, added: ‘ The evidence is beyond what I expected ’ The duo are aware that the findings could rock the Christian church, but insist the research is scientific and not theological.\n",

            "Obese workers are 'lazy' and 'unable to fulfil their roles' and as a result are less likely to be hired, a new survey has revealed.\n",
            "Almost half of 1,000 British companies questioned said they are less inclined to recruit an applicant after interview if they are obese or overweight.\n",
            "Among the reasons given were that overweight workers 'are unable to play a full role in the business', 'they're lazy', and 'they wouldn't be able to do the job required', the research shows.\n",
            "Beverley Sunderland, managing director, at Crosslands Employment Solicitors, who commissioned the research, said: 'Our research shows that prejudiced attitudes towards hiring obese workers are rife among British employers '.\n",
            "A survey of 1,000 British companies revealed almost half are less inclined to recruit an obese applicant, fearing 'they're lazy', and 'unable to fulfil their roles as required', because of their weight.\n",
            "The findings come in the wake of a European court case brought by unions and lawyers on behalf of 25st childminder Karsten Kaltoft, 50, who claimed he was sacked by his local authority in Denmark in 2010 for being too fat.\n",
            "In December European judges ruled that obesity qualified as a disability if it 'hinders the full and effective participation of the person on an equal basis with other workers', when doing their job.\n",
            "Body Mass Index, calculated from a person's weight and height, is accepted as a reliable indicator of obesity.\n",
            "According to the World Health Organisation, the ideal BMI for most adults is between 18 5 and 24 9.\n",
            "If a person's BMI is 25 to 29 9, they are classed as overweight.\n",
            "At between 30 and 39 9 they are obese and 40 or over is very – or morbidly – obese.\n",
            "Doctors say being overweight or obese can increase the risk of health problems, including heart disease, strokes, type 2 diabetes and some cancers.\n",
            "Earlier this year the European Court of Justice's advocate general, Niilo Jaaskinen, who advises the court, suggested that very severe obesity – classified as a BMI of more than 40 – could be considered a disability.\n",
            "But yesterday's ruling does not state what level of obesity would be classed as 'disabled'.\n",
            "It stated: 'It is for the national court to determine whether [an individual's] obesity falls within the definition of 'disability' '.\n",
            "Ms Sunderland said following the case, 'it appears on the face of it that the odds are against you getting a job if you are overweight'.\n",
            "'But the law is on your side, as discrimination law warns against making \"stereotypical assumptions\" at every stage of the recruitment process and this applies to both existing employees, or people applying for a job,' she added.\n",
            "Given the ruling at the European Courts of Justice, employers now have to find way to accommodate obese workers who fall within this definition of 'disability', while larger job applicants need to ensure they are not discriminated against, Ms Sunderland said.\n",
            "Critics at the time warned it could encourage the overweight to avoid slimming down in the hope of securing a payout.\n",

            "The inquest in Oldham heard that Nathan - described by his family as a 'cheeky, happy boy' - trained to become an electrician so he could follow in his father's footsteps.\n",
            "The pair were both working at Eurofabs UK Ltd, a sheet metal manufacturer in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, when tragedy struck in September 2013.\n",
            "Nathan was told to climb up a ladder onto the walkway of a crane and test the lights in the building's roof, taking readings and shouting them down to his father - a task as easy as plugging in a television.\n",
            "But he accidentally touched a 400-volt busbar, a metal strip which conducts electricity within a switchboard, while he was trying to climb high enough to carry out the tests.\n",
            "Forensic pathologist Philip Lumb told the inquest he found burn marks consistent with electrocution on Nathan's arm.\n",
            "Family: The 19-year-old was working with his father David, an experienced electrician, at the time of his death.\n",
            "He said: 'I gather Nathan was an apprentice electrician who was working for his father and contracted by a company called Eurofabs to conduct a complete electrical inspection.\n",
            "'One of his duties was to inspect one part of the roof.\n",
            "In order to gain access, Nathan had to get on top of a toilet block and place a ladder against an electrical crane to access the platform where the lights were located.\n",
            "'His father was working in the premises at the time.\n",
            "A short time late his father saw Nathan fall head first into the roof of the toilet block, about 12ft.\n",

            "In a statement Mr Brown, 50, who has been an electrician for 32 years, said that his son had joined him as an apprentice in September 2012 after embarking on a three-year training course, and had completed health and safety training a month before the fatal accident.\n",
            "He said: 'As an apprentice he was learning on the job and only ever allowed to complete basic tasks such as basic electrics, switches, sockets and lights.\n",
            "'You would only ever allow Nathan to carry out work when safe for him to do so and work within capability, knowledge and competence '.\n",
            "Mr Brown said he had carried out work at the Eurofabs premises twice before, and on this occasion was carrying out a general electrical survey which he likened to an 'MOT '.\n",
            "He said he decided to put a ladder over the toilet block beneath a 10-tonne travelling crane and had not seen the busbar overhead.\n",
            "He told the inquest: 'As far as I am aware the busbar should have been marked up in a sleeve with the marking \"danger high voltage\".\n",

            "'Had I been aware of the presence of the busbars in such unprotected conditions then I would not have continued to take this work.\n",
            "In all 32 years' experience with busbars I have seen them properly protected and never come across exposed busbars as present on the day of the accident.\n",
            "'That was the worst and fastest day of my life.\n",
            "It's a blur but I can't get rid of some of those thoughts.\n",

            "Professor Susan Greenfield warned that unless people wake up to the damage that the gadget-filled, pharmaceutically-enhanced 21st century may be doing to our brains, we could be sleepwalking towards a future in which neuro-chip technology blurs the line between living and non-living machines, and between our bodies and the outside world.\n",

            "But in the last century, development of new technologies has increased dramatically.\n",

            "Jameela Jamil has the dazzling smile that you'd expect of a television presenter and former model.\n",
            "Yet the 29-year-old broadcaster is convinced her teeth - or rather, the dental work done on them - triggered a host of health problems that plagued her for nearly seven years.\n",
            "'From the age of 21, I would wake up in the morning with a puffy, swollen face feeling utterly hungover - even though I don't drink,' says Jameela, who has presented the Radio 1 Chart Show and programmes for Channel 4.\n",
            "'My head felt heavy and I was permanently exhausted.\n",
            "Occasionally, I would even faint.\n",
            "There were days when I'd arrive at work and the make-up artists would send me home because I just looked awful and felt terrible '.\n",
            "After several months of this, she went to a private doctor who referred her for tests.\n",
            "Jameela thought she might have a serious disease such as lupus, an auto-immune condition which can cause inflammation and swelling in the joints and other parts of the body.\n",
            "In fact, the tests suggested she had high levels of mercury.\n",
            "After other potential causes such as diet were ruled out, it was suggested the problem was down to the ten amalgam fillings she'd had as a child.\n",
            "So she spent £3,000 on having them all removed and replaced with white fillings.\n",
            "Dental amalgam has been used for more than 150 years, and every year 12 million fillings made from it are given to patients in Britain.\n",
            "Amalgam remains a standard material to use, especially on back teeth because it is particularly robust.\n",
            "It is made from a mixture of metals including silver, tin and copper.\n",
            "Liquid mercury is used to help mix these components together.\n",
            "Breathing in extremely high concentrations of mercury can trigger bronchitis and pneumonia and affect the central nervous system, causing muscle tremors.\n",
            "Long-term exposure to high levels can affect kidneys.\n",
            "But mercury poisoning is very rare, suggests Dr Prem Mahendra, a consultant haematologist at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham.\n",
            "'In 27 years as a haematologist I have never been asked to test for mercury,' he says.\n",
            "Dentists agree that when fillings are being put in or removed, the mercury can release vapour.\n",
            "This is absorbed into the bloodstream in the lungs and then taken to the kidneys to be passed out harmlessly in the urine.\n",
            "Blood tests showed she had high mercury levels.\n",
            "With nothing else to account for these raised levels, her fillings were pinpointed as the cause.\n",
            "But the amounts taken in from fillings is 'minuscule', says Salford dentist Dr Ben Atkins.\n",
            "Indeed, a review by the EU Commission's Scientific Committee in 2008 concluded there was no risk from amalgam, says Professor Damien Walmsley, the British Dental Association's scientific adviser.\n",
            "Amalgam is 'strong, durable and adaptable' and there is 'no evidence to suggest these fillings are anything other than safe to use', adds StJohn Crean, professor of medicine in dentistry and an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the University of Central Lancashire.\n",
            "It is true that mercury can sometimes cause sensitivity and soreness in teeth - 5 per cent of the population react to contact with amalgams in this way - but this poses no risk to health, adds Professor Walmsley.\n",
            "And yet dental amalgam is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway, because of patient concern about the risk.\n",
            "Finland and Japan have restrictions on its use, with a view to phasing it out.\n",
            "This follows research linking mercury to certain diseases.\n",
            "A 2012 review of 106 studies published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease suggested mercury from amalgams could be a contributing factor to the condition.\n",
            "But fillings aren't the only source of mercury.\n",
            "It can get into the blood through food - nearly all fish and shellfish contain traces, though the Food Standards Agency says this isn't a concern for most people.\n",
            "However, some fish and shellfish contain higher levels of mercury that could harm an unborn baby or young child's developing nervous system.\n",
            "That's why young children and women planning to have a baby or who are already pregnant or breastfeeding are advised to avoid fish that can have higher levels of mercury, such as shark, swordfish and marlin.\n",
            "Pregnant women are advised to limit their tuna to no more than two steaks or four medium-sized cans a week.\n",
            "And yet dental amalgam (pictured, posed by model) is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway, because of patient concern about the risk.\n",
            "But Jameela doesn't eat fish, so knew the mercury levels couldn't be due to her diet.\n",
            "She's allergic to peanuts, shellfish and dairy foods and at 12 was diagnosed with coeliac disease - a condition which causes an adverse reaction to gluten, found in wheat, barley and rye.\n",
            "Following blood tests, it was discovered that she had high mercury levels.\n",
            "With nothing else to account for these raised levels, her fillings were pinpointed as the cause.\n",
            "'All I could think of was I had to get rid of them,' says Jameela.\n",
            "But while she expected her symptoms to immediately subside once her fillings were removed, they continued to affect her over the next few years.\n",
            "'I hated the fatigue, the headaches, the fact I should have been fit and healthy but felt rotten all the time,' Jameela says.\n",
            "'I read up on this and discovered that not only does it take time for mercury levels to drop, but vapour can be released from the mercury when the fillings are removed and leak into the system.\n",
            "'I think that the mercury was affecting my immune and digestive system '.\n",
            "Dentist Dr Atkins has spoken to many patients who have wanted to have their silver fillings removed because they're concerned about the potential health issues.\n",
            "But he warns that removing amalgams can do more harm than good as more vapour can be inhaled into the system by doing this.\n",
            "'Aside from the fact there is no evidence to suggest amalgams are anything other than safe, every time a dentist drills a tooth, they remove a little dental tissue.\n",
            "So you are essentially damaging the tooth,' he says.\n",
            "The number of fillings in the average adult's mouth.\n",
            "Still struggling, Jameela saw a nutritionist who recommended drinking solutions made from clay and algae chlorella three times a day.\n",
            "These apparently bind to mercury and help remove it.\n",
            "She did this for two years, and tried various diets to tackle the 'inflammation' linked to the mercury that was making her ill 'For my 25th birthday, my flatmate gave me a piece of melon with a candle in it - cake was out of the question,' she says.\n",
            "'It took about a year before I started to feel better.\n",
            "It's all had a massive impact on my life '.\n",
            "However, Anton Emmanuel, consultant gastroenterologist at University College Hospital, London, is not convinced mercury could affect digestion in this way.\n",
            "'You would have to be exposed to massive overdoses of mercury for the gut to be affected,' he says.\n",
            "'Not in the level or forms that you get with mercury fillings.\n",

            "'There is so much we don't know about amalgam fillings.\n",

            "It is also preparing an overhaul of the way profiles look, expanding the number of interests people can add.\n",
            "Earlier this month Tinder rolled out ‘Tinder Plus’, a premium service allowing people to ‘undo’ a like or change their location.\n",
            "A study has found that nearly two thirds of dating app users are men - and one in five will pay for premium services.\n",
            "Sixteen to 34 year-olds make up the majority of mobile dating app users, accounting for 70 per cent of the total user base.\n",
            "The study, carried out by London-based research firm GlobalWebIndex, also found that six per cent of web users currently use a location-based dating app.\n",
            "Significantly, just a fifth of dating app users are paying for an online dating service,' co-authors Jason Mander and Felim McGrath said in the report.\n",
            "But now they have set a limit on the number of ‘likes’ a user can perform in one day - which seems to be set at 100.\n",
            "When a user reaches this limit, the app tells them ‘You’re Out of Likes’, and gives a countdown clock until 24 hours are up so they can start swiping again.\n",
            "But, below this clock, a big red button says ‘Get Unlimited Likes with Tinder Plus’.\n",
            "A price is then shown.\n",
            "But different users are reporting the app is asking for different amounts.\n",
            "It seems the prices range from around £1 49 a month to as high as £14 99 - but the reasons why are not clear.\n",
            "This means some users will pay £17 88 a year for Tinder Plus - but others, in the upper price category, will have to fork out a whopping £179 88 a year.\n",
            "This equates to some users inadvertently paying £162 more than others over the course of a year.\n",
            "Speaking to MailOnline, Rosette Pambakian, Vice President of Communications and Branding at Tinder, told MailOnline the app is testing out different price points ahead of a global release.\n",
            "'We are testing Tinder Plus in select markets at various price points before rolling it out globally,' she said.\n",
            "'The UK is one of our test markets, so a certain portion of the population was given access to Tinder Plus at varying price points '.\n",
            "However, it is still not clear how the app decides how much to charge a user - and whether it is based on location or activity.\n",
            "In addition, Tinder has not commented on whether a user will receive a refund if they ultimately paid over the odds for the final price of the service.\n",

            "An Israeli geologist claims he has ‘confirmed’ the existence and authenticity of a tomb belonging to Jesus and his son in Jerusalem.\n",
            "After extensive chemical tests, Dr Arye Shimron says he has linked the James Ossuary – a 1st-century chalk box that some believe hold the bones of Jesus' brother – to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood.\n",
            "The research could have enormous ramifications as it suggests that Jesus was married, fathered a child and that a physical resurrection did not take place.\n",
            "Scroll down for video.\n",
            "After running 150 chemical tests, an expert claims to have linked the James Ossuary (pictured) – a 1st-century chalk box that was used for containing the bones of the dead – to the long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood.\n",
            "According to geoarcheologist Dr Shimron, the 'son of God' was buried with nine other people, including ‘Judah, son of Jesus’ and his wife, named Mary.\n",
            "Dr Shimron’s work has renewed controversy over the Talpiot tomb, which was discovered in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus,The Jerusalem Post reported.\n",
            "Bones were discovered inside ossuaries, including one that bore the inscription, ‘Jesus, son of Joseph'.\n",
            "Others included the names Maria, Joseph, Mary, Yose, Matthew and most controversially, ‘Judah, son of Jesus’.\n",
            "Joseph, Mary and Jesus were all common names at the time and a statistician from the University of Toronto said that they each made up eight per cent of the population.\n",
            "However, a very small percentage would have had the same family name combination as described in the Bible.\n",
            "Dr Shimron’s work has renewed the controversy over the Talpiot tomb, which was found in 1980 and dates back to the Second Temple period and the time of Jesus (a portrait is pictured) The long-disputed long disputed ‘Jesus Family tomb’ in the city’s East Talpiot neighbourhood (marked) and is now sealed beneath a concrete slab after building work took place some years ago.\n",
            "Probing this connection, Dr Shimron and documentary maker Simcha Jacobovici looked closer at the ossuaries, including the James Ossuary, which is held by a private owner and bears the inscription, ‘James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus’.\n",
            "The James Ossuary is a first century chalk example of a box that was used to hold the bones of the dead.\n",
            "But it stands out because it bears the inscription 'James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus' on one side.\n",
            "The inscription is considered significant because it may provide archaeological evidence of Jesus,.\n",
            "The existence of the ossuary was announced in 2002, but its authenticity was immediately challenged.\n",
            "The box's owner was charged with forging part of the inscription and while he was found innocent seven years later, the judge said the acquittal 'does not mean that the inscription on the ossuary is authentic or that it was written 2,000 years ago'.\n",
            "Now, Dr Shimron claims the chemical signature on the ‘crust’ of the box matches that of a tomb in Jerusalem known as the ‘Jesus Family tomb’ where other ossuaries were found bearing the names of Jesus and Mary as well as ‘Judah, son of Jesus’.\n",
            "The owner of the ossuary, Oded Golan, was accused of forging the inscription shortly after its discovery by an academic from the Sorbonne in Paris, but he was later found innocent.\n",
            "Other experts and archaeologists have rejected the claim that the Jerusalem tomb is connected with Jesus at all.\n",
            "Recently Dr Shimron gained access to the James Ossuary and scraped beneath the box's patina, the layer that forms on metal over time.\n",
            "He ran around 150 tests on the chemistry of samples from 25 different ossuaries – 15 of which were from unrelated tombs – and found that traces of magnesium, iron and silicon from the James Ossuary matched the chemical signature of Talpiot tomb.\n",
            "The Talpiot ossuaries were covered in a thick layer of ‘Rendzina’ soil, which is characteristic of the hills of East Jerusalem when they were found and has a unique chemistry.\n",
            "Dr Shimron worked from the assumption that an earthquake of 363AD flooded the tomb with soil and mud to cover the ossuaries, effectively forming a vacuum and freezing them in time.\n",
            "Soil that seeped into the box matched that found in the Talpiot ossuaries, indicating that it had lain for years alongside others in the ‘holy’ location.\n",
            "Bones were discovered there in ossuaries, or chalk boxes, including one that bears the inscription, ‘Jesus, son of Joseph' with others bearing the names of Maria, Joseph, Mary, Yose, Matthew and most controversially, ‘Judah, son of Jesus’.\n",
            "Here an inscription that says 'Yoseph' on an ossuary.\n",
            "Because bones were found in the ossuaries, it could be argued that there was no bodily resurrection (portrayed in this tapestry) which is the belief of more traditional Christians, while others accept the event was spiritual.\n",
            "Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to a writer and leading atheist activist.\n",
            "David Fitzgerald, a San Francisco based author, believes he has compiled compelling evidence that proves Jesus did not exist.\n",
            "He claims there are no contemporary mentions of Jesus in historical accounts from the time when he was supposed to have lived, yet other Jewish sect leaders from the time do appear.\n",
            "Jesus Christ was not a real person and is probably the result of a combination of stories about several different individuals, according to a writer and leading atheist activist.\n",
            "A mosaic of Christ is shown.\n",
            "He also points to discrepancies in the early gospels of Mark, Matthew and Luke, claiming these were written decades after the supposed time of Jesus.\n",
            "Instead he insists the disciples of Jesus were also probably not real and their names only later attached to the gospels to lend them credence.\n",
            "Speaking to MailOnline, he said: 'There is a paradox that Jesus did all these amazing things and taught all these amazing things yet no one heard of him outside his immediate cult for nearly 100 years.\n",
            "'Or it means he didn't do all these things at all.\n",
            "'The first gospel of Christianity appears to have been a literary allegory that were written decades after the time they portray.\n",

            "The famous statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is shown.\n",
            "'By the time of Paul there appears to have been plenty of different \"Lord's suppers\" as he complains about the existence of other gospels and messiahs.\n",
            "'It appears that early Christianity managed to take the stories from these other faiths and incorporate them into the story of Jesus '.\n",
            "Mr Fitzgerald said: 'There is nothing implausible to think that Jesus was a real person, but I just don't think that he can have been a single person if he existed at all.\n",
            "'We also have no mention of Jesus in other historical texts from the time.\n",
            "There were certainly people writing about Judea at the time like Philo of Alexandria.\n",
            "'During this period there were many other messiahs and wannabe messiahs who did far less exciting things than Jesus, but all of them managed something Jesus did not - to make a dent on the historical record.\n",
            "'Two billion people believe all these miracles happened yet there is no evidence they did '.\n",
            "Jacobovici told The Jerusalem Post: ‘This find illustrates that the James Ossuary is authentic and the Jesus Family tomb indeed belongs to the family of Jesus of Nazareth ’ Dr Shumron told The New York Times: ‘I think I’ve got really powerful, virtually unequivocal evidence that the James ossuary spent most of its lifetime, or death time, in the Talpiot Tomb ’ The retired senior researchers of the Geological Survey of Israel, added: ‘ The evidence is beyond what I expected ’ The duo are aware that the findings could rock the Christian church, but insist the research is scientific and not theological.\n",

            "Obese workers are 'lazy' and 'unable to fulfil their roles' and as a result are less likely to be hired, a new survey has revealed.\n",
            "Almost half of 1,000 British companies questioned said they are less inclined to recruit an applicant after interview if they are obese or overweight.\n",
            "Among the reasons given were that overweight workers 'are unable to play a full role in the business', 'they're lazy', and 'they wouldn't be able to do the job required', the research shows.\n",
            "Beverley Sunderland, managing director, at Crosslands Employment Solicitors, who commissioned the research, said: 'Our research shows that prejudiced attitudes towards hiring obese workers are rife among British employers '.\n",
            "A survey of 1,000 British companies revealed almost half are less inclined to recruit an obese applicant, fearing 'they're lazy', and 'unable to fulfil their roles as required', because of their weight.\n",
            "The findings come in the wake of a European court case brought by unions and lawyers on behalf of 25st childminder Karsten Kaltoft, 50, who claimed he was sacked by his local authority in Denmark in 2010 for being too fat.\n",
            "In December European judges ruled that obesity qualified as a disability if it 'hinders the full and effective participation of the person on an equal basis with other workers', when doing their job.\n",
            "Body Mass Index, calculated from a person's weight and height, is accepted as a reliable indicator of obesity.\n",
            "According to the World Health Organisation, the ideal BMI for most adults is between 18 5 and 24 9.\n",
            "If a person's BMI is 25 to 29 9, they are classed as overweight.\n",
            "At between 30 and 39 9 they are obese and 40 or over is very – or morbidly – obese.\n",
            "Doctors say being overweight or obese can increase the risk of health problems, including heart disease, strokes, type 2 diabetes and some cancers.\n",
            "Earlier this year the European Court of Justice's advocate general, Niilo Jaaskinen, who advises the court, suggested that very severe obesity – classified as a BMI of more than 40 – could be considered a disability.\n",
            "But yesterday's ruling does not state what level of obesity would be classed as 'disabled'.\n",
            "It stated: 'It is for the national court to determine whether [an individual's] obesity falls within the definition of 'disability' '.\n",
            "Ms Sunderland said following the case, 'it appears on the face of it that the odds are against you getting a job if you are overweight'.\n",
            "'But the law is on your side, as discrimination law warns against making \"stereotypical assumptions\" at every stage of the recruitment process and this applies to both existing employees, or people applying for a job,' she added.\n",
            "Given the ruling at the European Courts of Justice, employers now have to find way to accommodate obese workers who fall within this definition of 'disability', while larger job applicants need to ensure they are not discriminated against, Ms Sunderland said.\n",
            "Critics at the time warned it could encourage the overweight to avoid slimming down in the hope of securing a payout.\n",
            "Companies could also face millions of pounds of costs to alter offices and factories, including providing:.\n",
            "The survey revealed 61 per cent of employers were worried about the potential costs to the business of accommodating the side effects of overweight staff.\n",

            "Sixty-three per cent also cited a fear of being taken to court on grounds of discrimination, if the disability needs of obese workers were not met.\n",
            "Just over a quarter (26 per cent) said they were less inclined to hire obese people due to their lack of awareness of the laws linked to employing overweight workers.\n",
            "Yet the lack of understanding of the law could land employers in hot water, Ms Sunderland warned.\n",
            "More than half of employers questioned were unaware that if an obese person tells an employer about their long-term conditions at interview and the company does not employ them, the applicant could try to claim disability discrimination on the basis their obesity prevented them being employed.\n",

            "During the weeks it had been running it also purchased a fake Louis Vuitton handbag, a baseball cap with a hidden camera and 200 Chesterfield cigarettes.\n",
            "The darknet market features more than 16,000 items that are sold in a way that allows the seller to remain anonymous.\n",
            "The ecstasy tablets were found to contain 90mg of MDMA and were destroyed by the Swiss authorities.\n",

            "This is a type of cushioning that the sports brand have developed that looks like polystyrene and offers support and comfort to the wearer.\n",
            "Adidas say the Boost cushioning also gives 'energy return' so the wearer can run more effortlessly.\n",
            "The adidas Boost technology is a type of cushioning that they say will deliver 'your greatest run ever' while the Primeknit fabric is said to 'allow the natural expansion of any foot shape' At £130, the shoes only offer value for money if you intend to run in them often but the bumpy undersole doesn't seem to be that durable.\n",
            "It certainly seems to have worked for the numerous elite athletes, including Jessica Ennis, who have worn Boost trainers thanks to sponsorship deals.\n",
            "Wilson Kipsang wore the adidas Adizero Adios version when he ran what was then a World Record time of 2:03:23 in Berlin in 2013.\n",
            "Speaking of the Ultra Boost version, which have been on sale since February at a RRP of £130, adidas executive Eric Liedtke said: 'Ultra BOOST represents the culmination of years of work and meticulous research striving to create the greatest running shoe ever.\n",

            "Adidas: The trainers come in black with purple embellishment for both men and women and are made using adidas Primeknit fabric which is said to 'allow the natural expansion of any foot shape '.\n",
            "The dark colour makes a refreshing change for women - who are often only offered running shoes in pink and pastel shades - while the Primeknit fabric does look stylish and professional.\n",
            "The Boost cushioning encompasses the shoe a bit like a hovercraft so they don't make your feet look small and dainty.\n",
            "But while friends I met for a run did observe my feet looked big in the trainers, they also admired the fashionable appearance of the shoe.\n",
            "Aldi: The supermarket's trainers look the part and come in a bright turquoise and pink shade for women and royal blue for men.\n",
            "The appearance is reminiscent of Brooks popular Adrenaline running shoes so friends didn't guess they were made by Aldi until I told them.\n",
            "The Aldi trainers feature reflective material - which is great for being seen when running at night - but the rest of the fabric used does look cheap.\n",
            "The outsole looks bulky and plastic so it doesn't look like it will have much give when running.\n",
            "LUCY'S VERDICT: FIT AND RUNNING FEEL.\n",
            "Adidas: The shoes have a tongue at the back of the heel so they can be pulled on easily and the Primeknit fabric makes it feel you're putting your foot into a comfortable sock.\n",
            "The laces are sleek and elastic so can be easily tied for a snug fit.\n",
            "Adidas shoes can often come up small, so it's advisable to buy a pair half a size larger than your usual shoe size.\n",
            "In doing so, I found my pair to be a perfect fit.\n",
            "My toes had plenty of space at the front so they didn't pinch when my foot pushed forward when I was running, and they weren't too lose at the heel so they didn't rub.\n",
            "Often after trying new running shoes blisters can form but this wasn't the case, even after a nine mile run in the shoes.\n",
            "The Boost cushioning gives a comfortable and springy feel and despite its bulky appearance, the shoes do not feel too heavy on the foot while running.\n",
            "Lucy found the Boost trainers, left, fitted well and felt comfortable on a long run, while the Aldi trainers, right, were adequate but felt bulkier and weren't as snug a fit.\n",
            "Aldi: The shoes are not available in half sizes so I opted for my usual shoe size, despite this they still felt too big.\n",
            "I ran in the same running socks I had worn when running in the adidas trainers but felt I could have used a thicker pair in order for the shoes to fit better.\n",
            "The trainers were not a snug fit so I felt I had too much room around my forefoot and tightening the laces further did not help alleviate the roomy feel.\n",
            "Wearing thicker socks did help but I still felt my feet were sliding around a bit too much.\n",
            "However, they didn't rub so I again didn't suffer from any blisters but they did feel less comfortable and weren't as well fitted as the adidas pair.\n",
            "The trainers also felt heavier on my feet than the Boost.\n",
            "Overall, they felt more sturdy then the adidas pair and I didn't feel like they adapted to my feet in the same way - running in them for a short run was fine but I wouldn't feel comfortable wearing them for a long run or when doing speed work.\n",
            "LUCY'S OVERALL VERDICT.\n",
            "To my surprise, the Aldi shoes on the whole looked and felt the part - although the fit wasn't ideal.\n",
            "I'd recommend these to runners on a budget who are just starting out, who may just be running two or three times a week and aren't sure yet if they'll stick with it.\n",
            "At £19 99, if you don't carry on running if your motivation wanes, you won't be too much out of pocket.\n",
            "The supportiveness of the shoes also means they would be suitable to wear at the gym or for walking.\n",
            "However, if you intend to carry on running, I'd recommend going to a specialist running shop to be fitted for a shoe exactly to your foot type.\n",

            "The adidas shoes felt comfortable and I was happy running in them for miles.\n",
            "Although they feel a little too bulky for speedwork, they're great for steady runs and I would run a marathon in them.\n",
            "I'm not convinced this Ultra Boost model is worth the £130 price tag though - unless you can run in them often to get value for money.\n",
            "I'm also not convinced that the unusual bumpy undersole they have will be that durable - after just a few runs the rubber has shown signs of wear.\n",
            "What I convinced by was the cushioning provided by the Boost technology.\n",
            "But in the future I would be more likely to buy the Adizero Adios version for speedwork and racing as they are lighter in weight and not as expensive as their Ultra counterparts.\n",

            "Nathan Brown, 19, was working with his father David, an experienced electrician, when he apparently touched a set of exposed electrical bars powering a crane.\n",
            "The shock caused him to fall 12ft head first onto the roof of a toilet block below the crane.\n",

            "Accident: Nathan fell 12ft from a ladder after being electrocuted, and later died of his injuries.\n",
            "The inquest in Oldham heard that Nathan - described by his family as a 'cheeky, happy boy' - trained to become an electrician so he could follow in his father's footsteps.\n",
            "The pair were both working at Eurofabs UK Ltd, a sheet metal manufacturer in Rochdale, Greater Manchester, when tragedy struck in September 2013.\n",
            "Nathan was told to climb up a ladder onto the walkway of a crane and test the lights in the building's roof, taking readings and shouting them down to his father - a task as easy as plugging in a television.\n",
            "But he accidentally touched a 400-volt busbar, a metal strip which conducts electricity within a switchboard, while he was trying to climb high enough to carry out the tests.\n",
            "Forensic pathologist Philip Lumb told the inquest he found burn marks consistent with electrocution on Nathan's arm.\n",
            "Family: The 19-year-old was working with his father David, an experienced electrician, at the time of his death.\n",
            "He said: 'I gather Nathan was an apprentice electrician who was working for his father and contracted by a company called Eurofabs to conduct a complete electrical inspection.\n",
            "'One of his duties was to inspect one part of the roof.\n",
            "In order to gain access, Nathan had to get on top of a toilet block and place a ladder against an electrical crane to access the platform where the lights were located.\n",
            "'His father was working in the premises at the time.\n",
            "A short time late his father saw Nathan fall head first into the roof of the toilet block, about 12ft.\n",
            "He did not note any sounds of attempts to break his fall.\n",
            "'He went to attend to him but found him in a collapsed condition, although his father said he may be able to feel a pulse '.\n",
            "Dr Lumb told the inquest the cause of Nathan's death was electrocution and that he probably suffered cardiac arrest before falling to the ground.\n",
            "His mother Nicole, 47, said she learnt of the accident when she was called by her other son Gary, who worked at Eurofabs.\n",
            "She told the inquest: 'He said, \"Don't panic mum but Nathan has had a fall \".\n",

            "In a statement Mr Brown, 50, who has been an electrician for 32 years, said that his son had joined him as an apprentice in September 2012 after embarking on a three-year training course, and had completed health and safety training a month before the fatal accident.\n",
            "He said: 'As an apprentice he was learning on the job and only ever allowed to complete basic tasks such as basic electrics, switches, sockets and lights.\n",
            "'You would only ever allow Nathan to carry out work when safe for him to do so and work within capability, knowledge and competence '.\n",
            "Mr Brown said he had carried out work at the Eurofabs premises twice before, and on this occasion was carrying out a general electrical survey which he likened to an 'MOT '.\n",
            "He said he decided to put a ladder over the toilet block beneath a 10-tonne travelling crane and had not seen the busbar overhead.\n",
            "He told the inquest: 'As far as I am aware the busbar should have been marked up in a sleeve with the marking \"danger high voltage\".\n",

            "In all 32 years' experience with busbars I have seen them properly protected and never come across exposed busbars as present on the day of the accident.\n",

            "It's a blur but I can't get rid of some of those thoughts.\n",

            "Researchers observed randomly selected parents with children who looked between 18 months and five years old at playgrounds in New York.\n",
            "Children are more likely to engage in risky behaviour when those looking after them are distracted by texting or talking on the phone, the study showed (file picture) They measured factors such as the adult’s level of engagement with the child and how distracted they seemed.\n",
            "The researchers also observed how often the child took risks such as jumping off moving swings or going down a slide head-first.\n",
            "Children whose carers were distracted were ‘significantly’ more likely to behave in this way.\n",
            "The researchers also observed how often the child took risks such as jumping off moving swings or going down a slide head-first and found children whose carers were distracted were ‘significantly’ more likely to behave in this way.\n",

            "Three children fell while the researchers were observing them although none was seriously hurt.\n",
            "Study author Ruth Milanaik, of Cohen Children’s Medical Centre in New York, called on gadget-obsessed parents to keep a closer eye on their offspring, saying: ‘Increased awareness of limiting electronic distractions and other activities that interfere with supervision should be considered ’ A neuroscientist claims that modern technology such as computer tablets and mobile phones could be changing the way our brains work.\n",
            "Professor Susan Greenfield warned that unless people wake up to the damage that the gadget-filled, pharmaceutically-enhanced 21st century may be doing to our brains, we could be sleepwalking towards a future in which neuro-chip technology blurs the line between living and non-living machines, and between our bodies and the outside world.\n",
            "Electronic devices such as mobile phones and computer tablets could be anging the way our brains work, according to a neuroscientist.\n",

            "Jameela Jamil has the dazzling smile that you'd expect of a television presenter and former model.\n",
            "Yet the 29-year-old broadcaster is convinced her teeth - or rather, the dental work done on them - triggered a host of health problems that plagued her for nearly seven years.\n",
            "'From the age of 21, I would wake up in the morning with a puffy, swollen face feeling utterly hungover - even though I don't drink,' says Jameela, who has presented the Radio 1 Chart Show and programmes for Channel 4.\n",
            "'My head felt heavy and I was permanently exhausted.\n",
            "Occasionally, I would even faint.\n",
            "There were days when I'd arrive at work and the make-up artists would send me home because I just looked awful and felt terrible '.\n",
            "After several months of this, she went to a private doctor who referred her for tests.\n",
            "Jameela thought she might have a serious disease such as lupus, an auto-immune condition which can cause inflammation and swelling in the joints and other parts of the body.\n",
            "In fact, the tests suggested she had high levels of mercury.\n",
            "After other potential causes such as diet were ruled out, it was suggested the problem was down to the ten amalgam fillings she'd had as a child.\n",
            "So she spent £3,000 on having them all removed and replaced with white fillings.\n",
            "Dental amalgam has been used for more than 150 years, and every year 12 million fillings made from it are given to patients in Britain.\n",
            "Amalgam remains a standard material to use, especially on back teeth because it is particularly robust.\n",
            "It is made from a mixture of metals including silver, tin and copper.\n",
            "Liquid mercury is used to help mix these components together.\n",
            "Breathing in extremely high concentrations of mercury can trigger bronchitis and pneumonia and affect the central nervous system, causing muscle tremors.\n",
            "Long-term exposure to high levels can affect kidneys.\n",
            "But mercury poisoning is very rare, suggests Dr Prem Mahendra, a consultant haematologist at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham.\n",
            "'In 27 years as a haematologist I have never been asked to test for mercury,' he says.\n",
            "Dentists agree that when fillings are being put in or removed, the mercury can release vapour.\n",
            "This is absorbed into the bloodstream in the lungs and then taken to the kidneys to be passed out harmlessly in the urine.\n",
            "Blood tests showed she had high mercury levels.\n",
            "With nothing else to account for these raised levels, her fillings were pinpointed as the cause.\n",
            "But the amounts taken in from fillings is 'minuscule', says Salford dentist Dr Ben Atkins.\n",
            "Indeed, a review by the EU Commission's Scientific Committee in 2008 concluded there was no risk from amalgam, says Professor Damien Walmsley, the British Dental Association's scientific adviser.\n",
            "Amalgam is 'strong, durable and adaptable' and there is 'no evidence to suggest these fillings are anything other than safe to use', adds StJohn Crean, professor of medicine in dentistry and an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at the University of Central Lancashire.\n",
            "It is true that mercury can sometimes cause sensitivity and soreness in teeth - 5 per cent of the population react to contact with amalgams in this way - but this poses no risk to health, adds Professor Walmsley.\n",
            "And yet dental amalgam is banned in countries such as Sweden and Norway, because of patient concern about the risk.\n",
            "Finland and Japan have restrictions on its use, with a view to phasing it out.\n",
            "This follows research linking mercury to certain diseases.\n",
            "A 2012 review of 106 studies published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease suggested mercury from amalgams could be a contributing factor to the condition.\n",
            "But fillings aren't the only source of mercury.\n",
            "It can get into the blood through food - nearly all fish and shellfish contain traces, though the Food Standards Agency says this isn't a concern for most people.\n",
            "However, some fish and shellfish contain higher levels of mercury that could harm an unborn baby or young child's developing nervous system.\n",
            "That's why young children and women planning to have a baby or who are already pregnant or breastfeeding are advised to avoid fish that can have higher levels of mercury, such as shark, swordfish and marlin.\n",
            "Pregnant women are advised to limit their tuna to no more than two steaks or four medium-sized cans a week.\n",

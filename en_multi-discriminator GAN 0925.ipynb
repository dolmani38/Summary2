The bishop of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A virus in late September and early October. The state Health Department has issued an advisory of exposure for anyone who attended five churches and took communion. Bishop John Folda (pictured) of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A . State Immunization Program Manager Molly Howell says the risk is low, but officials feel it's important to alert people to the possible exposure. The diocese announced on Monday that Bishop John Folda is taking time off after being diagnosed with hepatitis A. The diocese says he contracted the infection through contaminated food while attending a conference for newly ordained bishops in Italy last month. Symptoms of hepatitis A include fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea and abdominal discomfort. Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota (pictured) is where the bishop is located .\""

            "An engineer by trade, he's been taking apart flight data recorders and recovering the data from them for over two decades.\n",
            "Campbell says he thrives on the technical challenge of accident investigation, but there's another factor that attracts him to his chosen line of work.\n",
            "\"Anything you can do to improve safety, improve the safety of the traveling public -- that's rewarding,\" he says.\n",
            "Just a handful of countries have the capability and technical know-how to decipher what's inside a black box.\n",
            "And if the Malaysians, who by international convention are in charge of the investigation into MH370, select Australia to take the lead, the devices will be brought here.\n",
            "'Object of interest' found.\n",
            "Retrieving the memory board.\n",
            "We start by the sink.\n",
            "Once the flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder is retrieved from more than 4500 meters below the surface of the Indian Ocean, it will be packed in water in a plastic bin to stop any salt or chemicals from solidifying and damaging the memory board, says Campbell.\n",
            "When the recorder arrives at the lab, Campbell or another investigator will rinse the recorder with distilled water, then begin the process of taking it apart.\n",
            "Sometimes getting the data is simple.\n",
            "\"A lot of our work is with undamaged recorders and it's very easy to download them, much as you would a USB memory stick,\" Campbell says, as he flips open a slot on the end of the recorder.\n",
            "But the process becomes much more technical if the recorders are damaged by fire or water.\n",
            "On the shelves of the lab's main room are examples of black boxes that have survived some of the worst conditions.\n",
            "Their metal casing is warped and torn, or their bright orange exterior charred black.\n",
            "But even with these recorders, Campbell still has options to tackle what some might consider an impossible task.\n",
            "That's because the only part of the flight data recorder that investigators really need intact is a small rectangular box called the Crash Survivable Memory Unit (CSMU).\n",
            "Campbell unscrews a couple of bolts.\n",
            "Wearing gloves and grounded to an anti-static mat, he begins peeling off layer upon layer of housing and protective insulation.\n",
            "In the center, is a memory board with eight flash memory chips, no bigger than the palm of his hand.\n",
            "This is where the vital data, and potentially the answers, live.\n",
            "In the case of the Boeing 777, Campbell says, the flight data recorder captures about 2,000 parameters for up to 25 hours.\n",
            "Those include everything from altitude and airspeed, to flap settings, engine performance, even cabin temperature and pressure.\n",
            "Campbell says some of the key parameters are recorded as often as eight times per second.\n",
            "The cockpit voice recorder captures four audio channels for a maximum of two hours before overwriting.\n",
            "One of the most challenging scenarios is when the board itself is damaged: \"We could take each individual chip off the circuit board, read those out individually, and then with the help of the manufacturer, piece all that information together,\" Campbell explains.\n",
            "If there's water damage, Campbell says he will rinse the board very carefully, then use a water displacement liquid, before drying out the circuit board in an oven.\n",
            "That process can take a couple of days.\n",
            "Decoding the data.\n",
            "When the raw data is downloaded from the recorder, it comes out as binary computer code, a slew of zeros and ones.\n",
            "Using a document provided by the aircraft manufacturer, investigators are able to decode each piece of data, and begin the process of getting a clearer picture of what happened and when.\n",
            "To illustrate the point of just what the information gathered from a flight data recorder can show, Campbell takes us through a heavy door into the soundproof audio analysis lab and pulls up an animation on a monitor.\n",
            "For the next 90 seconds we watch an animated representation of a 2010 twin propeller plane crash in Darwin, Australia, when a simulated engine failure went wrong after takeoff, tragically ending in the death of both pilots on board.\n",
            "Campbell says having this visual representation is a vital tool in helping the public understand an accident: \"There's a satisfaction in working out what happened with the accident and the conclusions, and the closure that that brings \".\n",
            "Closure that any investigator, wherever the black boxes from MH370 end up, might hope to bring to the loved ones of those on board the missing Malaysian Airlines flight.\n",

            "You might think that the advent of satellite imagery and tools such as Google maps has improved our view of the world, but this isn’t necessarily the case, according to James Wan writing in the Guardian.\n",
            "Much of this is due to technical reasons, said Mr Wan, while others inconsistences are caused by ideological assumptions that can change the way we see the world.\n",
            "The biggest challenge is that it is impossible to portray the reality of the spherical world on a flat map – a problem that has haunted cartographers for centuries.\n",

            "But in reality Africa is larger than both.\n",
            "In fact, you can fit north America into Africa and still have space for India, Argentina, Tunisia and some left over, notes Mr Wan.\n",
            "Greenland, meanwhile, is 1/14th the size of the continent as can be seen in Gall-Peters equal projection, which provides the correct proportion of land mass to the continents.\n",

            "(CNN) -- One can hardly read the news these days without learning that yet another American corporation has announced plans to invert, which is corporate-speak for restructuring as a foreign company to avoid U S taxes.\n",
            "It's a trend that has increased exponentially over the past decade with barely a peep from Congress.\n",
            "Now that corporate giants such as Pfizer, Walgreen, Medtronic and Mylan have made bids to invert by merging with foreign companies and will be eligible to claim their headquarters are offshore to avoid U S taxes, Congress may finally act.\n",
            "These large corporations have publicly asserted they are moving their headquarters, but they really won't change the way they do business.\n",
            "Medtronic, for example, is buying an Ireland-based company.\n",
            "If the merger goes through, the company has said it will maintain \"operational headquarters\" in Minneapolis, where the company is currently based.\n",
            "In other words, not much will change except the company will claim to be foreign.\n",
            "(Medtronic officials say the move is not about avoiding taxes and that the firm will still face substantial taxes; the firm does have the right to cancel the deal if Congress changes the law in a way that removes the tax benefits of inversion ).\n",
            "Walgreen, the nation's largest drug retailer, has said it is considering moving its headquarters to Switzerland.\n",
            "Inversions are just another ploy that corporations use to reduce or eliminate their U S tax bills.\n",
            "According to the Congressional Research Service, legislation to limit corporate inversions could provide an additional $19 5 billion in revenue over 10 years.\n",
            "Even among corporations that aren't pursing inversions, shifting profits offshore to avoid U S taxes is a huge problem.\n",
            "For example, American corporations reported to the IRS that subsidiaries in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands collectively earned profits equal to 16 times the gross domestic product of those countries, according to recent data.\n",
            "It's clearly impossible for companies to earn profits in a country that are exponentially larger than that country's entire economy, further proving companies are using accounting gimmicks to avoid U S taxes.\n",
            "American corporations engage in these tricks because they can defer paying U S taxes on alleged offshore earnings until they officially bring those profits to the United States, which may never happen.\n",
            "Corporations get a permanent break when they invert because the United States will not tax profits earned outside its borders.\n",
            "Corporate inversions are often followed by earnings stripping, a maneuver that artificially shifts profits into lower-tax or zero-tax countries.\n",
            "A recent exposÃ© explains how the highly profitable manufacturer Ingersoll Rand suddenly began reporting U S losses or very small profits each year after inverting to become a Bermuda corporation in 2001.\n",
            "This did not reflect any actual loss of U S customers or business.\n",
            "Rather, the corporation accomplished this by loaning $3 billion to its U S subsidiary, which then deducted the interest payments on the debt to effectively wipe out its U S income for tax purposes.\n",
            "Defenders of corporate inversions often argue the United States' 35% statutory corporate tax rate is too high compared to that of other nations and therefore puts companies at a competitive disadvantage, but most U S companies pay nowhere near that rate.\n",
            "Defenders also claim profits earned in the United States will always be taxed here.\n",
            "But the earnings stripping practiced by Ingersoll Rand and other inverted companies suggests this is not true.\n",
            "The ultimate goal of much multinational tax planning is making profits appear to be earned in countries with a zero or low tax rate.\n",
            "Reducing the nation's corporate tax rate cannot address the fact that many corporations are employing various means to avoid U S taxes altogether.\n",
            "Companies that have recently sought inversions continue to benefit vastly from public investments.\n",
            "The drugs and devices made by Pfizer and Medtronic, which are often sold by Walgreen, would have far fewer buyers if not for Medicaid, Medicare and other federal health programs.\n",
            "They would not exist without federal investments in research and education and in the infrastructure that makes commerce possible.\n",
            "Taxpayers should be outraged that these companies have no qualms about benefiting immensely from the U S economic system without contributing their fair share.\n",
            "But Congress can easily fix this by moving forward with a White House proposal to bar corporations that are obviously American from pretending to be foreign.\n",
            "The plan would sensibly treat newly merged companies as American if they are majority owned by shareholders of the original American company, or if they are managed and controlled inside the United States and have substantial business here.\n",
            "There's much more to be done to reform America's tax code, but we can't afford to wait for lawmakers to settle how to approach that challenge.\n",
            "If Congress waits too long, there won't be much of a corporate tax left to reform.\n",

            "Cheaper farmland and proximity to population centres are fueling growth in Amish colonies in The Empire State, a study out of Pennsylvania shows.\n",
            "The Amish, many of them from Ohio or Pennsylvania, have set up 10 new settlements in New York since 2010 - growth that doubles other states.\n",
            "That population has grown by nearly a third in two years, to 13,000.\n",
            "Amish communities are currently in 28 U S states, but more communities are popping up in New York over the last few years.\n",
            "The first New York Amish districts were established in the Conewango Valley in 1949, but in-migration slowed until about 10 years ago.\n",
            "As recently as 1991, there were just 3,900 Amish in the state.\n",
            "Elizabethtown College professor Don Kraybill, who directed the study, said the movement has been driven by productive and underpriced land.\n",
            "Factors such as weather, growing season and congenial neighbours and local officials have also contributed to the population boom.\n",
            "In the 1980s and 90s Kentucky played that role for the Amish, while more recently it was Wisconsin, Mr Kraybill said.\n",
            "New York has lower land prices in rural areas than Pennsylvania and Ohio, states that together account for about half of the U S Amish population.\n",
            "New York also has more areas of rural isolation, according to Mr Kraybill.\n",
            "'If you want to get away from the suburbs and the high-tech world, there are more places to hide in New York.\n",
            "'New York, Kentucky, Illinois and Kansas have experienced the largest net gain in Amish households since 2006, the study found.\n",
            "The largest net losers were Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Delaware and Ohio, although states with large Amish populations can grow even if they lose households because existing families normally have many children.\n",
            "The Amish emigrated to Pennsylvania from Switzerland and Germany about 300 years ago.\n",
            "Today, the nationwide Amish population totals about 261,000.\n",
            "Nearly all descend from a group of about 5,000 a century ago.\n",
            "'Empire State of Mind': An Amish man works in the field in Centerville, N Y , a town with an established Amish community.\n",
            "While their Christian beliefs and practices can vary from settlement to settlement, or from church to church, they were defined for study purposes as people who use horse-and-buggy transportation, and speak a dialect of Pennsylvania German or Swiss German.\n",
            "Mr Kraybill said: 'It's remarkable that a horse-and-buggy people like the Amish are thriving in the midst of high-tech, Twitter America '.\n",
            "Some areas of concentrated Amish populations in Pennsylvania, including Lancaster County, have experienced overall residential and commercial growth that can leave little room for the Amish way of life, so they make the decision to hire a tractor-trailer and head for someplace more remote.\n",
            "Large Amish families sometimes move into new areas to find farmland for the younger generations, while in other cases they are more motivated by a desire to preserve traditional aspects of their family life and to resolve disputes about church rules, said Karen Johnson-Weiner, an anthropology professor at the State University of New York at Potsdam.\n",
            "Ms Johnson-Weiner, whose book on the state's Amish was published last year, said: 'The Amish moving to New York are going to be, for the most part, very conservative.\n",
            "That means they're not going to be so willing to compromise or fit in '.\n",
            "The Amish have been involved in disputes in New York over zoning, construction practices and electronic filing of sales taxes, while some areas have capitalized on local Amish communities for tourism purposes.\n",
            "Ms Johnson-Weiner said some new Amish arrivals are buying land that has not been farmed since the earlier decades of the 20th century.\n",
            "'The families farming those farms are ready to retire and there aren't any young people ready to take the farm over, so you sell to the Amish,' she said.\n",
            "'They're revitalising farming, I would say, in many of those areas '.\n",
            "Mr Kraybill said Amish migration in general often consists of younger couples looking for cheaper farmland or new locations to set up small microenterprises.\n",
            "It can cost just a few thousand dollars to start manufacturing furniture or quilts, for example, he said.\n",
            "Other Amish migrants can be multigenerational families moving together so they can afford to buy several adjacent farms at the same time.\n",
            "Mr Kraybill said prime farmland in Lancaster County currently costs about $15,000 an acre, a daunting challenge for a young farmer, along with the expense of buying livestock and farm equipment.\n",
            "That makes land prices of $2,000 an acre in other states very attractive.\n",
            "Pennsylvania had the nation's largest Amish population in the new survey, just over 61,000, with Ohio a close second, about 400 people behind.\n",
            "Indiana ranked third, 46,000, Wisconsin fourth, 16,000, and New York fifth.\n",

            "Father of two Richard McLuckie, 48, and his friend Stuart Mackenzie-Walker, 51, dreamt up a series of board games including Love It Or Hate It and Who Put The Marmite In The Fridge, over long evenings spent playing games and drinking wine.\n",
            "They won permission to use the name Marmite from brand owner, Unilever, before going onto Dragons' Den to ask for funding.\n",
            "But the pair, who have been friends since childhood when they lived across a glen from each other in Argyll, nearly lost their chance when they weren't allowed to mention the name Marmite to the inquisitive Dragons.\n",

            "'They didn't want any mention of it til it was signed off, so we were worried the Dragons wouldn't be interested '.\n",
            "Three Dragons took their money off the table early, leaving Duncan Bannatyne and Peter Jones demanding to know more.\n",

            "He and Mr Mackenzie-Walker developed their ideas for games in a series of dinners over the years, but only decided to launch their business in 2009 after the property market crashed and Mr McLuckie needed a new job.\n",
            "First they came up with Liar Liar, in which players try to persuade their opponents to believe made-up facts, and Eurobabble, a modern version of Chinese Whispers in which players translate from one language to another and another.\n",
            "In Who Put The Marmite In The Fridge, players have to avoid being left with the jar of Marmite.\n",

            "'We thought we'd really like Piers Linney and Kelly Hoppen but in fact we thought Piers was quite dull and Kelly was a little bit rude and dismissive,' Mr McLuckie said.\n",

            "'We thought Peter Jones would be fun, which he was, and we thought Duncan Bannatyne would be a hard task-master, when in fact he was lovely - we are so pleased to be working with those two.\n",

            "I began my investigation aboard the trawlers that plunder the seas to provide the feed for the prawn farms along Thailand’s shoreline.\n",
            "While on board, I discovered that trafficked labourers from Burma and Cambodia are forced to work 20 hours a day, seven days a week, on boats where they are often beaten, abused, even killed by unscrupulous skippers.\n",

            "This practice, which sees the nets weighted down so that they sink to the sea bed, is enormously destructive.\n",
            "Entire tranches of marine life are effectively swept away and habitats and ecosystems that might have been there for centuries are destroyed.\n",
            "Breeding populations of many marine species are being all but destroyed and with them the futures of local fishermen who, until the arrival of the bottom trawlers, had been harvesting sustainable catches of local fish for decades.\n",

            "It’s only really the rocks and the weed that go over the side; everything else is shovelled into an already stinking hold.\n",
            "Many of these boats do have ice-controlled holds, but they are reserved for commercially valuable catches.\n",
            "The trash fish go straight into a filthy compartment where, with boats often at sea for days at a time, they soon start to rot.\n",
            "Damage: The Thai fishing trade leaves serious environmental damage in its wake and pollution in the ocean.\n",
            "By the time they return to port, the stench from these holds is almost unimaginable and there are regular reports of crewmen fainting and even dying after they’ve been sent into the holds to help with unloading, only to be overcome by the toxic fumes.\n",
            "These men are often at sea for months, even years at a time, thanks to the unscrupulous practice of transferring crew from a returning vessel loaded with fish, to an empty trawler setting out.\n",
            "In such harsh working conditions, where disobedience is often met with a beating from a metal pipe or even a bullet, suicides are common and murders not unknown.\n",
            "One crewman I spoke to had been shot at four times and had seen at least one crewmate killed.\n",
            "These desperate men are dying unnoticed, far out at sea, hundreds of miles from their homes and family Once the trawlers return to port, the commercially valuable fish are unloaded first and sold at the dockside market.\n",
            "Putrid: The king prawns are fed on 'trash fish' It is only later in the day, when the market has cleared and the port almost seems to have shut down, that the trash fish trucks arrive.\n",
            "Time and again, I witnessed the boats’ stinking holds being unloaded and their rotting cargo shovelled into ten-tonne dumper trucks.\n",
            "From here, it is a very smelly ride to an industrial processing plant, where the feed destined for prawn farms is produced.\n",
            "It is produced amid swarms of flies, temperatures that can approach 38C and a sweltering humidity of 100 per cent.\n",
            "The stench is foul.\n",
            "Load upon load of putrid fish and decaying marine creatures is poured into fetid storage containers.\n",
            "Every now and then you spot the eye of a beautiful coral fish or the glint of a long-dead starfish as the noxious mess is crushed and passed through a series of ovens until the final product — fish flour — is obtained.\n",
            "Transformed into pellets, this is then driven to the prawn farms that have all but destroyed Thailand’s mangrove forests.\n",
            "If you’d driven down the coast of the Gulf of Thailand 20 or 30 years ago you’d have seen mile after mile of these flooded forests, an incredible breeding ground for fish and a natural barrier that protected Thai farmers and their land from tsunamis.\n",
            "Today, however, most of these forests are gone.\n",
            "In their place is mile after mile of prawn ponds, their valuable contents protected by high fencing and security lighting.\n",
            "In these ponds, prawns are farmed on an industrial scale to meet booming demand from consumers in North America and Europe.\n",
            "In Britain, we consume about 85,000 tonnes of prawns a year, two-thirds of which are warm-water prawns like those farmed in Thailand.\n",
            "The trade is worth £450 million in Britain alone.\n",
            "Prawns need brackish, slightly salty water, which is why former mangrove forests that have been cleared of their trees and cut off by sluices from the sea are ideal.\n",
            "But prawns also need feeding — a lot of feeding.\n",
            "Spend a day peering through one of those security fences and you’ll see men coming out every few hours to toss another bucket of ‘feed’ to the growing prawns.\n",
            "I watched from the side of one prawn pond as they prepared to harvest the fattened prawns.\n",
            "The sluices were opened and the prawns caught in a filter as the water drained out.\n",
            "They are beheaded and frozen in minutes but, in many cases, the filthy lagoon water, a grim cocktail of several months’ worth of excreta and food waste, is simply washed out into what’s left of the surrounding mangrove forests or straight out to sea.\n",
            "Concerned about Thailand: In Hugh's Fish Fight, TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall went to examine farmed King Prawns, at Asia's biggest prawn market near Bangkok.\n",
            "Thailand does have marine conservation laws designed to protect both its coastal waters and specially designated marine conservation reserves.\n",
            "But these are poorly policed and routinely ignored by ruthless commercial fishing fleets whose only concern is short-term profit at any cost.\n",
            "Meanwhile, thousands of miles from this marine destruction, we unthinkingly bite into a delicious skewer of tiger prawns, perhaps coated with garlic butter.\n",
            "But what are the alternatives to industrially produced prawns?.\n",
            "Some certification schemes for so-called ‘responsibly produced’ prawns do exist, and marginal improvements to farming practices are beginning to take place.\n",
            "But in my research I have found that none of the certification schemes properly address the damage being done to local communities or the destruction to the marine environment caused by trash fishing.\n",
            "King prawns can also be produced organically.\n",
            "Naturally, this makes them very expensive for supermarket customers.\n",
            "But even organic prawn farming usually requires the destruction of wild mangrove forest — even if trash fishing has been avoided.\n",
            "As consumers, however, we can look elsewhere.\n",

            "But both my parents understood the importance of significant events, so when opportunity knocked, my parents opened up all doors for me.\n",
            "I grew up knowing full well that my country wasn't allowed to participate in international sports following the sporting boycott of 1977 which had been placed on South Africa in a protest against apartheid -- a system of racial segregation enforced by the ruling white minority.\n",
            "So when the South African rugby team toured New Zealand in 1981, my parents made sure that I was awoken at 04:30 to watch all three Test matches.\n",
            "I got to snuggle between my parents -- and a first -- they put the television in their bedroom.\n",
            "It was the \"flour bomb\" Test -- where a light aircraft flew over Auckland's Eden Park before and during the match, dropping flour bombs, smoke bombs and anti-apartheid leaflets -- where I began to realize that other countries didn't like us.\n",
            "I didn't understand why at the time, and it hurt a little.\n",
            "Later that day, I'll never forget my parents telling me that it could be a long time before I witnessed something like this again.\n",
            "I was six at the time.\n",

            "My first trip to Cape Town's Newlands Cricket Ground was to watch Western Province play a domestic match.\n",
            "It must have been my mom's first trip too, because I distinctly remember entering the ground and ending up sitting on the grass embankment, which was reserved for colored people.\n",

            "A kind couple offered us some fruit, so we stayed.\n",
            "I was blissfully unaware of how significant this possibly was.\n",

            "This time we were seated in the correct place, in the Oaks Enclosure, which ironically these days is a grass embankment.\n",
            "I remember the hype and the excitement about this special day.\n",
            "I had seen the Windies in their warmup game against Western Province and I knew that they were something special.\n",
            "They had vicious fast bowlers and flamboyant batsmen.\n",

            "It was with incredible interest and fascination that I watched \"Branded a rebel\" -- a CNN World Sport documentary which first screened last year.\n",
            "It gave me greater insight into the players, the tour, West Indies cricket and indeed my home country.\n",
            "And while \"Branded a rebel\" is an appropriate title for the program, it could have just as easily been titled \"Branded Heroes \".\n",
            "That's what they were to us white South Africans, and I think deep down the Windies players felt that too.\n",
            "It's all about what side of the line you were sitting, I guess.\n",
            "On their return home, the West Indian players were shunned by society and some were forced to move abroad to make a living.\n",
            "The poverty and other such ills which befell some of their players really tugged at all of my emotions.\n",
            "I started thinking what we as South Africans could have done for them.\n",

            "And something else -- they taught us not to take ourselves too seriously by showing how much one can enjoy themselves on the sports field.\n",
            "Their smiles, I'll never forget their smiles.\n",
            "Each of their names is entrenched in my memory, and of all of those who saw the matches.\n",
            "They became part of my upbringing and that of thousands of South African fans.\n",
            "What I didn't understand at the time, was what it took for those men to actually land on our shores (money aside).\n",
            "They must have been scared -- really scared.\n",
            "I know I would have been.\n",
            "In the interview with Clive Lloyd, longtime captain of the official West Indies team that dominated world cricket for two decades, he said no amount of money would have made him support a racist regime.\n",
            "I would go as far as to say no amount of money would have put my fears at ease to travel to South Africa.\n",
            "Courage.\n",

            "In their cricket and in their collective decisions, and I respect that.\n",
            "A few years later, I did wonder how the black West Indian players got to travel using \"white\" transport and stay in \"white\" areas.\n",
            "I remember asking my mom how that worked.\n",
            "She didn't know, but you could see that my political curiosity was growing.\n",
            "I was disappointed that more players didn't take up the opportunity of being interviewed for the documentary.\n",
            "I was intrigued by Stephenson, King and Murray's thoughts, motives and reflective answers.\n",
            "There seemed no real regret, which was fascinating and pleasing for some reason.\n",
            "As for those who declined an interview, their wounds obviously cut deep.\n",
            "Stephenson was just how I remember him.\n",
            "Boisterous, bubbly and always looking on the bright side of life.\n",
            "We got to know him well here, as he returned to play for the Orange Free State.\n",
            "The fact that he still has all his memorabilia means that the tour meant something to him, and that he feels part of change and change of attitudes in South Africa.\n",
            "I don't know if they changed us as a society but I'd like to thing so, even if it was an indescribably fractured and dysfunctional society.\n",
            "And by this I mean that white South Africa packed out every cricket ground to watch black West Indies, went home and made sure that \"The Cosby Show\" was the most watched program on television -- and yet black people were pretty much denied and excluded from everything.\n",
            "Heart bleeds.\n",
            "\"Branded a rebel\" showed balanced reporting.\n",
            "I like the fact that you saw the tour from a South African perspective as well.\n",
            "Great players like Graeme Pollock, Barry Richards and Clive Rice also effectively served life bans for being, well, South African, and the program understood that.\n",
            "I know that, fundamentally, the tour was morally corrupt, but for an innocent nine-year-old devoid of political allegiances and beliefs, it was simply a chance to see the world's best cricketers entertaining us on the world's most beautiful stage.\n",
            "Ultimately, I'd also like to believe that South African cricketers and administrators were trying to show the government the way forward, and that unity through sport was possible.\n",

            "They are more likely to use a biological weapon than a nuclear one -- and the results could be devastating, the chairman of the commission told CNN.\n",
            "\"The consequences of a biological attack are almost beyond comprehension.\n",
            "It would be 9/11 times 10 or a hundred in terms of the number of people who would be killed,\" former Sen Bob Graham said.\n",
            "He cited the flu virus that killed millions of people in 1918 as an example.\n",
            "\"Today it is still in the laboratory, but if it should get out and into the hands of scientists who knew how to use it for a violent purpose, we could have multiple times the 40 million people who were killed 100 years ago,\" he said.\n",
            "Watch how officials worry about a biological terror attack ».\n",
            "The U S government \"needs to move more aggressively to limit\" the spread of biological weapons, the commission said in its report.\n",
            "Graham warned that such measures would be costly, but were necessary.\n",
            "\"The leadership of this country and the world will have to decide how much of a priority they place on avoiding the worst weapons in the world getting in the hands of the worst people in the world,\" he said.\n",

            "But I think our safety and security depend upon doing so,\" he added.\n",
            "Graham said a biological attack was more likely than a nuclear one because it would be easier to carry out.\n",

            "But the commission warned that there is also a threat of nuclear terrorism, both because more countries are developing nuclear weapons and because some existing nuclear powers are expanding their arsenals.\n",
            "\"Terrorist organizations are intent on acquiring nuclear weapons,\" said the report, which was published Tuesday on the Internet and will be officially released Wednesday.\n",
            "CNN obtained a copy of the report Monday evening.\n",
            "It cited testimony before the commission from former Sen Sam Nunn, who said that the \"risk of a nuclear weapon being used today is growing, not receding \".\n",

            "\"Many biological pathogens and nuclear materials around the world are poorly secured -- and thus vulnerable to theft by those who would put these materials to harmful use, or would sell them on the black market to potential terrorists,\" the report warned.\n",
            "The commission expressed particular concern about the nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea, and about Pakistan, which it described as \"the intersection of nuclear weapons and terrorism \".\n",
            "While observing that Pakistan is a U S ally, the report said, \"the next terrorist attack against the United States is likely to originate from within the Federally Administered Tribal Areas\" in Pakistan.\n",

            "Washington (CNN) -- The pilots of Northwest Flight 188 did not fall asleep when they overflew their destination by more than 100 miles in October, the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday in a detailed report on the wayward flight.\n",
            "The two pilots \"became distracted by a conversation\" about the airline's new work schedule system and by laptop computers they were using in violation of company policy and did not communicate with air traffic control for about 1 hour and 17 minutes while they cruised past their Minneapolis, Minnesota, destination at 37,000 feet, the NTSB said.\n",
            "The safety board also faulted the Federal Aviation Administration for air traffic control shortcomings.\n",
            "The NTSB report gives the most complete official account to date of the errant flight, which prompted the FAA to revoke both pilots' licenses, prompted the airline to suspend them from flying and prompted the FAA to adopt new procedures to notify the U S military in cases where the FAA loses contact with commercial aircraft.\n",
            "According to the account, the flight from San Diego, California, was routine until the plane was in the Denver, Colorado, region.\n",
            "There, air traffic controllers directed the crew of the Airbus A-320 to change their radio frequency.\n",
            "The co-pilot, or first officer, acknowledged the frequency change and read back the correct frequency.\n",
            "However, neither the captain nor the first officer contacted controllers on the new frequency until about 1 hour and 17 minutes later, when Winnipeg, Manitoba, controllers directed the crew to contact Minneapolis.\n",
            "The NTSB said that because of the proximity of the Winnipeg frequency to the last frequency acknowledged by the pilots (Winnipeg is 132 125 megahertz, while the last frequency used was 132 17) it is \"likely the first officer began to dial in the new frequency but never completed the frequency change by pushing an activation button.\n",
            "Nor did the first officer attempt to contact the next controller \".\n",
            "The NTSB said the frequency change likely occurred while the captain was taking a restroom break and while a flight attendant was serving dinner.\n",
            "\"These events may have distracted the first officer from completing the frequency change or attempting to contact the next ATC controller,\" the NTSB said.\n",
            "Further, the captain's absence would have prevented him from checking the co-pilot's actions.\n",
            "When the captain returned, the pilots became involved in a conversation over new scheduling procedures, and the first officer tutored the captain using their computers, the NTSB said.\n",
            "\"The pilots allowed this conversation to monopolize their attention,\" the board said.\n",
            "\"Both pilots state that they heard radio chatter but did not hear a radio call for NWA188 \".\n",
            "The laptop computers they used likely blocked their view of numerous visual alerts, including text messages sent by airline dispatchers and at least nine messages regarding their position on the airplane's primary flight display, the NTSB said.\n",
            "Northwest Airlines policy prohibited the use of the laptops, the NTSB said.\n",
            "Both pilots told the NTSB the first indication of anything unusual was when a flight attendant called to ask about their arrival time.\n",
            "The captain \"looked at his navigation display and saw Duluth [Minnesota] to his left and Eau Claire [Wisconsin] to his right,\" the board said.\n",
            "The NTSB said it could not determine why the pilots did not respond to numerous radio calls, but said it could be because the volume was turned down, the pilots were distracted or the plane was outside the coverage for the 121 5 megahertz transmitters.\n",
            "The NTSB faulted the FAA for not catching the pilots' errors earlier, saying the plane entered two Denver sectors uneventfully, but radio contact was not established in the next two sectors, where controllers were preparing for a shift change.\n",
            "\"Neither sector controller's relief briefing included information that communication had not been established\" with the plane, the NTSB said.\n",
            "The NTSB said the FAA had no standard procedures to indicate that an aircraft had not made radio contact when electronic radar handoffs of planes occurred from one sector to the next.\n",
            "\"Because of this lack of standardization, NWA188 passed through two Denver ATC sectors without the controllers being aware that it had not made radio contact,\" the safety board said.\n",
            "Almost 30 minutes had elapsed before the next sector's controller attempted to regain contact with the plane and realized the plane was unresponsive to radio calls, the board said.\n",
            "Recognizing the problem, controllers first attempted to regain contact by calling Northwest dispatchers, then by calling an emergency frequency, but did not use words such as \"emergency\" or \"mayday\" that may have helped capture the pilots' attention, the NTSB said.\n",
            "The pilots did not respond.\n",
            "As a result of the investigation and of the crash of an executive jet in Montana in 2009, the safety board is recommending steps to prevent a repeat of the incidents.\n",
            "Six days after the event, the FAA revoked the licenses of Capt.\n",
            "Timothy Bryan Cheney and First Officer Richard Irwin Cole, saying their lack of awareness that they had overflown the Minneapolis airport was \"completely unacceptable\" and \"put your passengers and your crew in serious jeopardy \".\n",
            "But in a settlement signed with the pilots on Monday, the pilots acknowledged no wrongdoing, and the FAA agreed to allow the pilots to reapply for their licenses in August, two months shorter than would ordinarily be allowed.\n",
            "A spokesman for Delta Airlines, which merged with Northwest, said this week the airlines' internal investigation is continuing.\n",
            "-------------------------------------------------- Summary 56--------------------------------------------------\n",
            "The NTSB said not why respond to numerous radio calls but it be the volume the pilots distracted outside the coverage for 121 megahertz transmitters and the first was when a attendant called to ask about their arrival and had sectors controller attempted to contact with the to radio calls board said.\n",
            "FAA for catching the pilots entered two Denver sectors but contact was not established in next two sectors for a shift and to account the San Diego California plane in the Denver Colorado region When returned pilots became over scheduling procedures and the officer tutored the captain using their the NTSB said.\n",

            "The group of unknown soldiers, who fell during heavy gunfire during a battle in Beaucamps-Ligny, France, could be identified thanks to DNA provided by the great-nephew of Private Frederick Thompson, who was reported missing in action at the age of 20.\n",

            "Historians believe he could be one of the 15 soldiers found in Beaucamps-Ligny, France, in 2009.\n",
            "And historians from the Commonwealth War Grave Commission hope that after the DNA testing has been undertaken, they will finally be able to discover their identities and give them a military funeral 100 years on.\n",
            "The remains of the soldiers were uncovered by farmers digging up sewers in 2009.\n",
            "Private Frederick Thompson, killed in action early in the First World War, may be identified nearly a century after his death.\n",
            "Archaeologists uncovered partial skeletal remains of 15 men - alongside toothbrushes, and brass buttons proving the men belonged to the 2nd Battalion York and Lancaster Regiment - after their remains were uncovered by farmers digging up sewers in 2009.\n",
            "One young soldier, Private Frederick Thompson, killed in action early in the First World War may be identified nearly a century after his death, from DNA provided by his great-nephew, in one of the first DNA tests on the soldier's remains.\n",
            "The commission managed to track down Private Thompson’s closest living relative, his great nephew Mr Saunders, and they are now awaiting the results of his DNA test to see if Private Thompson will be the first unknown soldier to be identified.\n",
            "Mr Saunders said: 'I had no idea that any of my relatives served in the Great War.\n",
            "I feel immensely proud to discover that my great uncle fought for his country.\n",

            "The number of discoveries of remains varies from year to year, but since 2003 the Commonwealth War Graves Commission has dealt with an average of about 18 cases each year.\n",
            "Over the last decade the highest number of discoveries was in 2007 when 24 cases were found, while the lowest was 12 cases in 2011.\n",
            "Each case can involve multiple sets of remains - bomber crews for example commonly involve seven casualties - but generally discoveries are of one or two casualties at a time.\n",
            "The most common cause of discoveries are building work or farmers ploughing fields.\n",
            "The vast majority of cases are in France and Belgium.\n",
            "In all instances, the responsibility for investigation and identification rests with the relevant service authority - the armed forces of the country for which the individual was serving.\n",
            "The commission’s responsibility begins when the remains are handed over for burial.\n",
            "The commission then identifies the appropriate cemetery - usually the closest Commonwealth War Cemetery in which there is space - manufacture the headstone, prepare the grave and care for the individual in perpetuity once the burial has taken place.\n",

            "The 2nd Battalion York and Lancaster Regiment had been based in Ireland at the outbreak of the war, landing in France on September 9, 1914, and taking part in the Battle of Armentihres.\n",
            "The battalion then headed to fight with the 6th Division along a line from Preniesques to Radinghem in an action that lasted from October 20 to 31.\n",
            "All the men will be laid to rest in the same graveyard with full military honours, to mark the centenary of their deaths in October 2014.\n",
            "An MOD spokesman said: 'The use of DNA can in some cases enable us to confirm the identity of remains that are discovered, but after many decades results may be inconclusive.\n",

            "About 580 million years ago, most organisms were simple, composed of individual cells occasionally organized into colonies.\n",
            "Over the following 70 or 80 million years, the rate of evolution accelerated by an order of magnitude (as defined in terms of the extinction and origination rate of species) and the diversity of life began to resemble that of today.\n",

            "\"The police and many legal experts have realized the drawbacks of laojiao and called to abolish the system, which has become outdated,\" Yu Mingyong, deputy president of Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court, was quoted as saying.\n",
            "\"Many of those released from laojiao find many difficulties returning to society, families and work after their personal freedom has been restricted in labor camps for several years \".\n",
            "Guangzhou still has about 100 people in labor camps, he said.\n",
            "Human Rights Watch welcomed the move but said there were few RTL camps and detainees in cities.\n",
            "It estimates Guangdong has as many as 18,000 detainees held in a network of facilities throughout the province.\n",
            "Despite the move to end the process -- originally aimed at reforming offenders through a mixture of hard labor and Marxist indoctrination -- HRW claims the changes are merely cosmetic and work camps have simply been relabeled drug detox centers.\n",
            "How it started.\n",
            "Reform Through Labor was set up in the 1950s under Mao Zedong and modeled on the Soviet \"gulags\" -- a place where \"counter-revolutionaries\" and \"class enemies\" could be detained without trial.\n",
            "Millions are believed to have died through overwork, suicide and harsh conditions until the system was overhauled in the 1970s when Deng Xiaoping released prisoners accused of political and religious offenses.\n",
            "According to the latest available figures from the Bureau of Re-education Through Labor under the Ministry of Justice, 160,000 people were held in 350 re-education through labor centers nationwide as of the end of 2008.\n",
            "The UNHCR says the figure is possibly as high as 190,000 people.\n",
            "Today the system empowers police to jail accused offenders -- from petty thieves and prostitutes to drug abusers -- for up to four years without a judicial hearing.\n",
            "Public criticism of the system has grown in China where petitioners against official corruption, \"subversives,\" such as Falun Gong practitioners or those simply finding themselves on the wrong side of powerful Communist Party figures, have also been sentenced to penal labor without trial.\n",
            "In a brief note in the official Nanfang Daily last week, the vice president of Guangzhou City, Yuming Yong, said the city's administrative courts had ceased hearing RTL cases in March, effectively scrapping the system.\n",
            "\"Judicial reform of RTL has been a priority this year,\" Yong told the Nanfang Daily.\n",
            "\"Guangzhou has stopped approval of re-education through labor (cases) further highlighting the protection of citizens' personal liberties \".\n",
            "An administrative tribunal official Xiao Zhixiong added that with no new detention cases being heard, the system would eventually be \"digested out\" but that specific reforms would be a matter for other relevant departments.\n",
            "In January this year, the central government in Beijing strongly hinted that it would begin scrapping the system although Guangzhou's announcement is the strongest indication yet that concrete steps have been taken.\n",
            "Cosmetic changes.\n",
            "While Guangdong province has a reputation for being progressive and reform-oriented, human rights groups are skeptical about the depth of change to the controversial jail system.\n",
            "Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch told CNN that reforms may simply be a cosmetic re-branding of an otherwise repressive system.\n",
            "\"Guangdong is at the vanguard of reform, that's their identity,\" Bequelin said.\n",
            "\"Unfortunately, this 'reform' essentially consists in changing the signboard at the labor camp from 'Re-education Through Labor' to 'Coercive Detoxification Center '\".\n",
            "He said Guangdong had been ready to move fast because the majority of the RTL detainees in the province -- 10,000 out of a total of 18,000 according to HRW â€” are drug offenders or users who posed little political threat to authorities in Beijing.\n",
            "\"It's not entirely clear to us what has become of the 8,000 RTL detainees who are not being shifted to the detoxification system.\n",
            "Some may have been shifted to yet another system of administrative detention, 'Custody and Education,' designed for people suspected of engaging in sex work or of having hired the services of sex workers,\" Bequelin said.\n",
            "These centers, HRW argues, also constitute arbitrary detention because deprivation of liberty results from administrative, rather than judicial, decisions.\n",
            "\"In other words, no trial, no lawyer, no appeal.\n",
            "And the conditions in these centers are consistently abusive,\" he added.\n",
            "He said that while it was encouraging that local authorities had stopped admitting new detainees while they awaited more concrete reforms from Beijing, the central government could reverse its proposals at any stage.\n",
            "\"As far as Human Rights Watch is concerned, the only way forward is to put a definitive end re-education through labor, not to shift detainees to another arbitrary system of detention, or establish a new system to warehouse minor offenders, petitioners, government critics, sex workers and offenders below the age of 18,\" Bequelin said.\n",
            "Backlash over exposed cases.\n",
            "Two high-profile cases that became public last year generated a massive backlash, forcing the government to address the thorny issue of RTL.\n",
            "In one case, a mother was sentenced to 18 months in a labor camp for \"disrupting social order\" after she repeatedly petitioned officials to execute men convicted of raping her 11-year-old daughter.\n",
            "In another case, a young village official was sent to a labor camp for two years for re-tweeting Weibo posts that were deemed seditious.\n",
            "While even Guangdong's progressive administration has stopped short of attacking the system, saying that it was \"not opposed to the use of coercive power and punishment by public security organs,\" recent official announcements have offered guarded criticism of RTL.\n",
            "\"The system was designed to maintain social order, prevent and reduce crimes by reforming people who committed minor offenses but were not punishable by the penal code,\" read one Xinhua editorial.\n",
            "\"It did play an important role in maintaining social order in specific periods, however, with the development of society and the legal system, its defects have become more and more evident \".\n",
